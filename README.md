This is our project Left2serve

The basic idea of this project is on the concept of reselling of food using our application on a discounted price so that wastage of food and loss can be prevented. 

We have 2 types of users here - the vendor and the customer. The vendor is the shop owner and the customer is the end user. Both of them have their separate interfaces. 

Vendor side: -He can create Hotspots (The places where the vendor shows up for discounted food using our project);
- Can add values for the hotspot (the amount of meals remaining, time available for the hotspot, location, veg/ non-veg)
- Can manipulate the orders recieved from the vendors
  
Customer side: -He can view hotspots in text as well as visual format in a map interface with pointers showing details about the Hotspot, the meal served and other details
- Place orders on the Hotspot

Other than this, there are other pages like Login and Sign up.
